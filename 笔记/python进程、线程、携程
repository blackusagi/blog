An executing instance of a program is called a process.
Each process provides the resources needed to execute a program. A process has a virtual address space, executable code, open handles
to system objects, a security context, a unique process identifier, environment variables, a priority class, minimum and maximum working
set sizes, and at least one thread of execution. Each process is started with a single thread, often called the primary thread, but can
create additional threads from any of its threads.

进程：程序的执行实例称为进程。
进程组成：虚拟地址空间、可执行代码、系统对象打开的句柄数、安全上下文、唯一的进程标识符、环境变量、优先级、最大最小工作集组成等，通常由一个主线程启动。
